======= CODE ======= 
1. GRAPHS WITH ALL 10 CRYPTOS
    - Import a dataset of all 10 cryptos (we don't want to keep wasting API calls)
        - has to be the same timeframe for plot indexing to work
    
    - run tests with original parameters for all 10 cryptos

    - run tests with the parameters we found to be the best on all 10 cryptos

    - export latex code and use these results in REPORT>#2


======= REPORT ======= 
1. FIGURE OUT LaTEX GRAPHS 
    - This is so we can put our multiple graphs from CODE>#1 into before/after graphs for REPORT>#2

    - matplotlib should be able to spit out the latex code for the graph

    - the issue is, we're gonna have to figure out how to put a bunch of graphs on top of each other

    - the only other way to do it would be to change our code (matplotlib) and make it overlay all the graphs itself
        - I'd be down, but we'd have to hold the instances of each graph in an array and figure out how to add them all to the graph
        - idk about you, but I'm not tryna restructure the entire ploting phase of the code to support multiple different graphs at once
        - probably easier to do it manually

2. SHOW BEFORE/AFTERS FOR ALL 10 CRYPTOS ON THE SAME GRAPH
    - First graph:
        - will contain all 10 cryptos
        - predictions are using the ORIGINAL parameters in the model

    - Second Graph:
        - will also contain all 10 cryptos
        - predictions are using the parameters that we found to be the best AFTER our tests

    - Hopefully, this will show that our improvements worked across the board, not just for that BTC sample we had

    - Move other graphs to appendix
        - Probably low-hanging fruit, not the end of the world if we don't have em

3. COMPUTER SPECS/SOFTWARE VERSIONS
    - HUGE miss, definitely important to have this

    CPU: Ryzen 7 2700x | 16 Cores (8 Physical, 16 Logical) @ 4.2 GHz Boost Clock
    GPU: RX 590 | 2304 Stream Processors @ 1545 MHz Boost Clock | 8 GB GDDR5 @ 8000 MHz
    RAM: 16 GB @ 3200 MHz


4. MAKE DIAGRAMS IN DRAW.IO 
    - The old diagrams were admittedly in PPT, that's on James
    - That said, they work functionally, so we can leave this one as low-hanging fruit if we have spare time

5. CITE ERROR EVALUATION
    - Basically: Why is RMSE a good thing to measure with this kind of data?

6. SHIT ON OTHER WORKS IN RELATED WORKS
    - Kinda self-explanatory
    
    - Will take up some room for sure tho
